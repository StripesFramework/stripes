/**
 * Interface that is used to provide a relatively simple formatting interface to the rest of the
 * system. Designed to wrap the complexity of the @link{DateFormat} classes in an interface that can
 * take two (or three if you include Locale) parameters from tags and apply formats in an
 * intelligent way.
 *
 * <p>In terms of lifecycle, a formatter will be instantiated, have setFormatType(),
 * setFormatString() and setLocale() called in rapid succession. If no values were supplied,
 * setFormatType() and setFormatString() may not be called - and implementations should select
 * reasonable defaults. Locale will always be provided. After the setters have been called, init()
 * will be called, and the Formatter should use this opportunity to construct any internal objects
 * necessary to perform formatting. The format() method will then be called one or more times before
 * the Formatter is eventually de-referenced.
