/**
 * A specialized type converter for converting a <b>single</b> input field/parameter value into one
 * or more Java objects contained in a <b>List</b>. Designed to handle the case where a user is
 * allowed to enter more than one value into a single field, separated by certain characters, that
 * should result in a number of Java objects being created.
 *
 * <p>For example imagine a search field where a user is allowed to enter one or more numbers. They
 * might enter "2 4 8 16". In this case the {@code OneToManyTypeConverter} will convert this to a
 * Collection of numbers with one entry for each of the four numbers shown above. The type of number
 * created ({@link java.lang.Integer}, {@link java.lang.Long} etc.) is inferred from the declaration
 * of the property on the {@code ActionBean}. For example:
 *
 * <p>{@code @Validate(converter=OneToManyTypeConverter.class) private List<Long> numbers;}
 *
 * <p>would result in the numbers being converted to Longs as opposed to any other numeric type.
 *
 * <p>The splitting of the input String is done using the {@link java.lang.String#split(String)}
 * method. The regular expression passed to {@code split()} is obtained by calling {@link
 * #getSplitRegex()}. By default the regular expression used will match an optional comma followed
 * by one or spaces (e.g. " " or ", " or " &nbsp; " etc.). This behaviour can easily be modified by
 * subclassing and overriding {@link #getSplitRegex()} to return a different regular expression
 * string.
 *
 * <p>The individual components of the String are then converted using an appropriate {@link
 * TypeConverter} which is looked up using the {@link TypeConverterFactory}. As a result the {@code
 * OneToManyTypeConverter} can be used to convert to a list of any type for which a {@code
 * TypeConverter} has been registered. If a usable {@code TypeConverter} cannot be discovered then
 * an Exception will be thrown! However, if you wish to use the {@code OneToManyTypeConverter} with
 * a {@code TypeConverter} which is not registered as the default converter for it's type you can
 * override this behaviour by subclassing this class and overriding {@link
 * #getSingleItemTypeConverter(Class)}.
 *
 * <p>Strictly speaking the {@code OneToManyTypeConverter} returns a {@link java.util.Collection} of
 * converted items. It does not have any way of inferring the collection type that should be used,
 * and so by default it will always return an instance of {@link java.util.List}. This behaviour can
 * easily be overridden by extending this class and overriding {@link #getCollectionInstance()}.
 *
 * <p>Note that the converter itself does not create any {@link ValidationError}s, but that by using
 * other {@link TypeConverter}s internally it is possible to produce one or more errors per item
 * split out of the input String!
