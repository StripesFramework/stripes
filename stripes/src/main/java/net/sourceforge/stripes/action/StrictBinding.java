/**
 * When applied to an {@link ActionBean}, this annotation turns on binding access controls. The
 * default policy is to deny binding to all properties. To enable binding on any given property, the
 * preferred method is to apply a {@link Validate} annotation to the property. (For nested
 * properties, use {@link ValidateNestedProperties}.) Even if validation is not necessary for the
 * property in question, a naked {@link Validate} annotation may still be used to enable binding.
 * Alternatively, binding can be enabled or disabled through the use of the {@link #allow()} and
 * {@link #deny()} elements of this annotation.
 *
 * <p>Properties may be named explicitly or by using globs. A single star (*) matches any property
 * of an element. Two stars (**) indicate any property of an element, including properties of that
 * property and so on. For security reasons, partial matches are not allowed so globs like
 * user.pass* will never match anything. Some examples:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code *} - any property of the {@link ActionBean} itself
 *   <li>{@code **} - any property of the {@link ActionBean} itself or its properties or their
 *       properties, and so on
 *   <li>{@code user.username, user.email} - the username and email property of the user property of
 *       the {@link ActionBean}
 *   <li>{@code user, user.*} - the user property and any property of the user
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #allow()} and {@link #deny()} elements are of type String[], but each string in the
 * array may be a comma-separated list of properties. Thus the {@code @StrictBinding(allow="user,
 * user.*")} is equivalent to {@code @StrictBinding(allow={ "user", "user.*" }}.
