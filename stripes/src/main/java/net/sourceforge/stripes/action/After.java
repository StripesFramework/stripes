/**
 * Specifies that the annotated method should be run <i>after</i> the specified {@link
 * LifecycleStage}(s). More than one LifecycleStage can be specified, in which case the method will
 * be run after each stage completes. If no LifecycleStage is specified then the default is to
 * execute the method after {@link LifecycleStage#EventHandling}. {@link LifecycleStage#RequestInit}
 * <b>cannot</b> be specified because there is no ActionBean to run a method on before the
 * ActionBean has been resolved!
 *
 * <p>The method may have any name, any access specifier (public, private etc.) and must take no
 * arguments. Methods may return values; if the value is a {@link
 * net.sourceforge.stripes.action.Resolution} it will be used immediately to terminate the request.
 * Any other values returned will be ignored.
 *
 * <p>Examples:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Runs only after the event handling method has been run
 * {@literal @After}
 * public void doStuff() {
 *    ...
 * }
 *
 * // Runs after binding and validation have completed
 * {@literal @After(stages = LifecycleStage.BindingAndValidation)}
 * public void doPostValidationStuff() {
 *    ...
 * }
 *
 * // Runs twice, once after each validation-related stage
 * {@literal @}After(stages = {LifecycleStage.BindingAndValidation, LifecycleStage.CustomValidation})
 * public void doMorePostValidationStuff() {
 *    ...
 * }
