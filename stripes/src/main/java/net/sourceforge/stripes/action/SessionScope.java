/**
 * <p>
 * Annotation that is used to specify that an ActionBean should be instantiated
 * and stored across requests in the Session scope. By default ActionBeans are
 * instantiated per-request, populated, used and then discarded at the end of
 * the request cycle. Using this annotation causes an ActionBean to live for
 * multiple request cycles. It will be instantiated and put into session on the
 * first request that references the ActionBean. A reference to the bean will
 * also be placed into RequestScope for each request that references the bean,
 * thereby allowing the rest of Stripes to treat it like any other
 * ActionBean.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Since session scope ActionBeans are not generally encouraged by the author,
 * very few allowances will be made in Stripes to accommodate session scope
 * beans. This means that additional mechanisms to handle session scope beans do
 * not exist. However, there are general mechanisms built in to Stripes that
 * will allow you to overcome most if not all issues that arise from Session
 * scoping ActionBeans.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * One major issue is how to clear out values from an ActionBean before the next
 * request cycle. It is suggested that this be done in the
 * ActionBean.setContext() method, which is guaranteed to be invoked before any
 * binding occurs. Note that this problem is two-fold. Firstly the browser does
 * not submit values for checkboxes that are de-selected. Secondly Stripes does
 * not invoke setters for parameters submitted in the request with values equal
 * to the empty-string. You may choose to simply null out such fields in
 * setContext() or use the available reference to the HttpServletRequest to find
 * out if empty values were submitted for fields, and null out just those
 * fields.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A second major issue is in using the validation service. The validation
 * service validates
 * <em>what was submitted in the request</em>. Therefore if a property is marked
 * are required, is present in the session scope bean, but is not submitted by
 * the user, it will generate a required field error. This may or may not be
 * desired behaviour. If it is not, it is suggested that the ActionBean
 * implement the ValidationErrorHandler interface to find out about the
 * validation errors generated, and take action accordingly.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Lastly, an alternative to session scoping for wizard pattern/page-spanning
 * forms that ActionBean authors may wish to consider is the use of the
 * {@link net.sourceforge.stripes.tag.WizardFieldsTag} which will carry all the
 * fields submitted in the request into the next request by writing hidden form
 * fields.</p>
