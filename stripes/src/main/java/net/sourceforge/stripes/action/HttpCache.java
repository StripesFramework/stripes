/**
 * This annotation can be applied to an event handler method or to an {@link ActionBean} class to
 * suggest to the HTTP client how it should cache the response. Classes will inherit this annotation
 * from their superclass. Method-level annotations override class-level annotations. This means, for
 * example, that applying {@code @HttpCache(allow=false)} to an {@link ActionBean} class turns off
 * client-side caching for all events except those that are annotated with
 * {@code @HttpCache(allow=true)}.
 *
 * <p>Some examples:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code @HttpCache} - Same behavior as if the annotation were not present. No headers are
 *       set.
 *   <li>{@code @HttpCache(allow=true)} - Same as above.
 *   <li>{@code @HttpCache(allow=false)} - Set headers to disable caching and immediately expire the
 *       document.
 *   <li>{@code @HttpCache(expires=600)} - Caching is allowed. The document expires in 10 minutes.
 * </ul>
