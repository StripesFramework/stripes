/**
 * Interface for all classes that respond to user interface events. Implementations receive
 * information about the event (usually a form submission) in two ways. The first is through a
 * ActionBeanContext object which will always be set on the ActionBean prior to any user implemented
 * &quot;handler&quot; methods being invoked. The second is through the setting of JavaBean style
 * properties on the object (and nested JavaBeans). Values submitted in an HTML Form will be bound
 * to a property on the object if such a property is defined. The ActionBeanContext is used
 * primarily to provide access to Servlet APIs such as the request and response, and other
 * information generated during the pre-processing of the request.
 *
 * <p>How Stripes determines which method to invoke is based on Annotations as opposed to a strict
 * interface. Firstly, each ActionBean should be annotated with a UrlBinding which specifies the
 * path within the web application that the ActionBean will be bound to. E.g:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;UrlBinding("/action/SampleAction")
 * public SampleActionBean implements ActionBean {
 * ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>At run time Stripes will discover all implementations of ActionBean and, when a form is
 * submitted, will locate the ActionBean to use by matching the path in the request to the
 * UrlBinding annotation on the ActionBean.
 *
 * <p>The way in which a specific event is mapped to a &quot;handler&quot; method can vary. The
 * default method used by Stripes is to identify the <em>name</em> of the button or image button
 * used to submit the request, and to find the handler method that can handle that event. The way
 * this is declared in the ActionBean is like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;HandlesEvent("SampleEvent")
 * public Resolution sample() throws Exception {
 *     ...
 *     return new ForwardResolution("/SampleJsp2.jsp");
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Event names specified in the HandlesEvent annotation should be unique within a given
 * ActionBean (and it's superclasses), but can be re-used across ActionBeans. For example, a given
 * ActionBean should not have two methods with the annotation <em>&#064;HandlesEvent("Update")</em>,
 * but it would be perfectly reasonable to have two different ActionBeans handle events, from
 * different forms, called Update.
 *
 * <p>It is also possible to designate a method as the default method for handling events in the
 * case that Stripes cannot figure out a specific handler method to invoke. This occurs most often
 * when a form is submitted by the user hitting the enter/return key, and so no form button is
 * activated. Essentially the default handler is specifying the default operation for your form. In
 * forms that have only one handler method, that method should always be declared as the default.
 * For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;HandlesEvent("Search")
 * &#064;DefaultHandler
 * public Resolution findUsers() throws Exception {
 *     ...
 *     return new ForwardResolution("/SearchResults.jsp");
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Handler methods have two options for what to do when they have finished their processing. The
 * preferred option is to return an instance of an implementation of Resolution. This keeps things
 * clean and makes it a little easier to change how things work down the road. The other option is
 * to return nothing, and simply use the Servlet API (available through the ActionBeanContext) to
 * render a response to the user directly.
 *
 * <p>An ActionBean may optionally implement the {@link ValidationErrorHandler} interface which
 * allows the ActionBean to modify what happens when validation errors occur.
