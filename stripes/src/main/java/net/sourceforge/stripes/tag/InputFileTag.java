 * and beyond a straight HTML input tag is that the tag will find its enclosing
 * form tag and ensure that the for is set to POST instead of GET, and that the
 * encoding type of the form is properly set to multipart/form-data as both
 * these settings are necessary to correctly perform file uploads.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Does not perform repopulation because default values for
 * {@literal <input type="file/>} are not allowed by the HTML specification. One
 * can only imagine this is because a malicious page author could steal a user's
 * files by defaulting the value and using JavaScript to auto-submit forms! As a
 * result the tag does not accept a body because it would have no use for any
 * generated content.</p>
