/**
 * <p>
 * Annotation used for injecting Spring managed beans into objects within
 * Stripes (usually ActionBeans). The value of the annotation represents the
 * name of the bean in the Spring application context to inject. If the value is
 * omitted then Stripes will attempt to auto-wire first by property/field name
 * and then by type.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Both methods and fields can be annotated. If a field is annotated Stripes
 * will use field access to attempt to inject the bean into the field. If a
 * method is annotated Stripes will attempt to invoke the method and supply it
 * the value to inject. In both cases non-public fields/methods are supported
 * (i.e. values can be injected into private fields and through private
 * methods).</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For a more details description of the injection process and how auto-wiring
 * occurs when explicit bean names are omitted see the {@link SpringHelper}
 * class.</p>
