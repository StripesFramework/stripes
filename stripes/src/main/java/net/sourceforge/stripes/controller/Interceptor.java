/**
 * Interface for classes which wish to intercept the processing of a request at various stages in
 * the Stripes lifecycle. To denote the {@link LifecycleStage} (or stages) at which an interceptor
 * should run, the class should be marked with an {@link Intercepts} annotation declaring one or
 * more lifecycle stages.
 *
 * <p>{@code Interceptors} execute <i>around</i> the intercepted lifecycle stage. Assuming for
 * simplicity's sake that a single interceptor is configured, any code in the {@link
 * #intercept(ExecutionContext)} method prior to calling {@code context.proceed()} will be executed
 * immediately prior to the lifecycle code. Any code after calling {@code context.proceed()} will be
 * executed immediately after the lifecycle code. For example the following implementation would
 * print out a message before and after validation and binding occur:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Intercepts(LifecycleStage.BindingAndValidation)
 * public class NoisyInterceptor implements Interceptor {
 *    public Resolution intercept(ExecutionContext context) {
 *        System.out.println("Before validation and binding!");
 *        Resolution r = context.proceed();
 *        System.out.println("After validation and binding!");
 *        return r;
 *    }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Interceptors can, in addition to adding behaviour, divert the flow of execution. They do this
 * by returning a {@link Resolution}. If an interceptor returns a Resolution Stripes will abort
 * processing of the current request and immediately execute the Resolution.
 *
 * <p>Interceptor developers must be careful to ensure that interceptors are well behaved. To
 * continue normal processing interceptors <b>must invoke {@code context.proceed()}</b>. Since a
 * given interceptor may be part of a stack of interceptors, or the lifecycle code may return a
 * resolution, the interceptor must return the Resolution produced by {@code context.proceed()}
 * unless it explicitly wishes to alter the flow of execution.
 *
 * <p>Interceptors gain access to information about the current execution environment through the
 * {@link ExecutionContext}. Through this they can access the ActionBean, the handler Method, the
 * lifecycle stage etc. Care must be taken to ensure that information is available before using it.
 * For example interceptors which execute around ActionBeanResolution will not have access to the
 * current ActionBean until after calling context.proceed() and will not have access to the event
 * name or handler method at all (HandlerResolution occurs after ActionBeanResolution).
 *
 * <p>Optionally, Interceptor classes may implement the {@link
 * net.sourceforge.stripes.config.ConfigurableComponent} interface. If implemented, the Interceptor
 * will have it's {@code init(Configuration)} method called after instantiation and before being
 * placed into service.
 *
 * <p>Interceptors are located by Stripes through it's {@link
 * net.sourceforge.stripes.config.Configuration}. To configure interceptors you can either implement
 * your own Configuration (probably by subclassing {@link
 * net.sourceforge.stripes.config.RuntimeConfiguration}), or more likely by listing out the
 * interceptors desired in the web.xml as specified in the documentation for {@link
 * net.sourceforge.stripes.config.RuntimeConfiguration#initInterceptors()}.
