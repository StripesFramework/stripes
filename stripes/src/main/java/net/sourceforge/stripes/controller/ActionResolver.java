 * <p>Resolvers are responsible for locating ActionBean instances that can handle the submitted

 *
 * <p>Throughout this class two terms are used that refer to similar but not interchangeable
 * concepts. {@code UrlBinding} refers to the exact URL to which a bean is bound, e.g.
 * {@code /account/Profile.action}.  {@code Path} refers to the path segment of the requested
 * URL and is generally composed of the URL binding and possibly some additional information,
 * e.g. {@code /account/Profile.action/edit}.  In general the methods in this class are capable
 * of taking in a {@code path} and extracting the {@code UrlBinding} from it.</p>
