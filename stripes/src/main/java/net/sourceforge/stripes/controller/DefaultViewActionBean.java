/**
 * A special purpose ActionBean that is used by the NameBasedActionResolver when a valid ActionBean
 * cannot be found for a URL. If the URL can be successfully translated into a JSP URL and a JSP
 * exists, an instance of this ActionBean is created that will forward the user to the appropriate
 * JSP.
 *
 * <p>Because this ActionBean does not have a default no-arg constructor, even though it gets bound
 * to a URL, if that URL is hit the ActionBean cannot be instantiated and therefore cannot be
 * accessed directly by a user playing with the URL.
