/**
 * <p>
 * This exception indicates that a URL does not contain enough information to
 * map it to a single {@link ActionBean} class. In some cases, a URL may match
 * more than one URL binding.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose you have two ActionBeans with the URL bindings
 * <code>/foo/{param}/bar</code> and <code>/foo/{param}/blah</code>. The paths
 * {@code /foo} and {@code /foo/X} -- while legal, since any number of
 * parameters or literals may be omitted from the end of a clean URL -- match
 * both of the URL bindings. Since Stripes cannot determine from the URL the
 * ActionBean to which to dispatch the request, it throws this exception to
 * indicate the conflict.
