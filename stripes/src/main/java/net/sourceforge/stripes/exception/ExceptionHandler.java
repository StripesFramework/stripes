/**
 * Component that is delegated to in order to handle any exceptions that are raised during the
 * processing of a request which is processed through the Stripes Filter. Implementations have two
 * options for handling an exception:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Handle the exception and return
 *   <li>Rethrown the exception if it cannot be handled
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In the first case it is up to the exception handler to provide an appropriate response to the
 * user. This might involve forwarding or redirecting the user to an error page, or providing a
 * streaming response in the case of an AJAX client.
 *
 * <p>If the ExceptionHandler elects not to handle an Exception and re-throws it then the exception
 * will percolate up and the container will handle it using whatever error pages are configured.
