/**
 * <p>
 * A marker interface for delegate exception handlers to be used with the
 * {@link DelegatingExceptionHandler}. Note that the DelegatingExceptionHandler
 * must be configured as the {@link ExceptionHandler} for the application in
 * order for AutoExceptionHandlers to be discovered and used.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * AutoExceptionHandlers can define one or more methods to handle different
 * kinds of exceptions. Each method must have the following signature:</p>
 *
 * <pre>public Resolution handle(Type exception, HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res);</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * where <code>Type</code> can be any subclass of {@link java.lang.Throwable}.
 * Handler methods do not have to follow any naming convention. In the above
 * example 'handle' is used, but any other name, e.g. 'run', 'handleException'
 * etc. would have worked as well. The return type is only loosely enforced; if
 * the method returns an object and it is a
 * {@link net.sourceforge.stripes.action.Resolution} then it will be executed,
 * otherwise it will be ignored.</p>
