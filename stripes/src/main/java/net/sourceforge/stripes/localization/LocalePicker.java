 * method called getLocale(), but ask yourself this: if your site only supports
 * English, and the user's browser requests the Japanese locale, in what locale
 * should you accept their input?</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The LocalPicker is given access to the request and can use any mechanism it
 * chooses to decide upon a Locale. However, it must return a valid locale. It
 * is suggested that if a locale cannot be chosen that the picker return the
 * system locale.</p>
