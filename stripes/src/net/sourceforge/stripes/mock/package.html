    <p>Mock objects that implement many of the Servlet and Http Servlet interfaces. These
       classes allow for the standalone testing of ActionBeans in their native habitat
       without the need to deploy anything to a Servlet container.</p>

    <p>The two classes of most interest are <tt>MockServletContext</tt> which provides a
    simple mock implementation of a servlet context that can accept requests and process them,
    and <tt>MockRoundtrip</tt> which encapsulates several mock objects to provide an easy to use
    interface to generate a request to an ActionBean, process it and then verify the results.</p>
