 * Works in conjunction with {@link SecurityInterceptor} to prevent unauthenticated users from
 * viewing information they are not allowed to view. Apply this annotation to an {@link ActionBean}
 * class to indicate that users are allowed to access it even if they are not authenticated. Most of
 * this application's {@link ActionBean}s require authentication so it's easier to flag those that
 * do <em>not</em> require authentication.
