http://www.stripesframework.org/

This file documents the steps involved in upgrading an application from Stripes
1.6.0 to Stripes 1.6.0-Jakarta.

1. Required Steps
2. Suggested Steps
3. Backwards Incompatibilities

1. Required Steps
   --------------
   -> Replace your existing stripes.jar with the new copy from the lib/ directory
      of the distribution.
   -> Replace your existing commons-logging.jar with the new copy from the lib/
      directory of the distribution
   -> For security reasons, Log4jLogger has been removed and replaced with SimpleJdk14Logger.
      If you want to continue to use log4j, copy the source from the Stripes 1.6.0 branch
      into your application source and use at your own risk.
   -> If you are using cos.jar it has been removed for security reasons. Commons-fileupload2 is now
      the default. Remove cos.jar and remove the CosMultipartWrapper from your web.xml if it is
      referenced there.

2. Backwards Incompatibilities
   ---------------------------
   Stripes 1.6.0-Jakarta is not completely
   backwards compatible with Stripes 1.6.0 (non-Jakarta). However, most of the
   incompatible change are quite small and require only minor edits to your
   application (mentioned above). This section documents these incompatibilities.

   -> Log4jLogger has been removed and the dependency on log4j has been removed.
   -> cos.jar and CosMultipartWrapper have been removed.
   -> commons-fileupload has been replaced with commons-fileupload2
   -> jakarta.mail dependency has been removed.
